# SkillWeave Substrate Map (`.skillweave/`)

This document defines the authoritative top-level directory and file layout of the `.skillweave/` substrate. It maps each area to its primary **owner skill**, its **lifecycle phase**, its **mutability policy**, and its **operational purpose**.

Every area under `.skillweave/` is machine-checked for documentation completeness and drift prevention via `tests/unit/test_substrate_drift.py`.

---

## 1. Overview and Core Invariants

The `.skillweave/` directory is the **local, generated, git-excluded** state and artifact substrate for SkillWeave projects. It houses planning artifacts, persistent architecture memory, lifecycle configurations, prompt chains, release gates, and execution journals.

It is created in a consuming project by the preflight (`SkillWeavePersistence.ensure_folder_structure`), which makes the folder and its subdirectories on demand. It is **not** shipped: `tests/packaging/test_discovery_installed.py` asserts that the installed distribution contains no `.skillweave/` at all, and `pyproject.toml` packages only `py.typed`.

### Invariants:
1. **Isolated Output Routing**: All AI planning, execution, and validation artifacts reside inside `.skillweave/`—never in arbitrary root-level directories.
2. **Single Ownership**: Every top-level area has exactly one primary owning skill or subsystem responsible for its schema, read/write semantics, and evolution.
3. **Phase Traceability**: Every area is bound to a defined lifecycle phase (Discovery, Blueprint, Design, Build, Release, Launch, Post-Release) or designated as Cross-Cutting/Global.
4. **Drift Enforcement**: Any new file or directory introduced into `.skillweave/` must be registered and documented in this specification; undocumented additions fail CI gates.
5. **Git Exclusion**: `.skillweave/` belongs in `.gitignore` in every project, including this one. What SkillWeave generates into the substrate — PRDs, specifications, sequences, discovery findings, handover records — is intellectual property, and for an open-core product it is the part that is not open. A public repository must never carry it. The private per-org planning repository is the only place substrate content is tracked, and it is tracked there deliberately rather than as a side effect of a tool writing into a working tree.

   `Versioned` in the Mutability column below means *revised across iterations*. It does not mean *tracked in git*.
6. **Reachability is Injection, not Tracking**: A dispatched lane needs the PRD inside its worktree. That is solved by copying or linking it in at dispatch time (`regen-sequence.py`; see the 1.5.1 dispatch initiative), never by committing the substrate so that `git worktree add` happens to carry it along. Tracking the substrate to make it reachable trades an IP boundary for a convenience the dispatcher already provides.

### Current deviation from invariant 5

This repository does not yet satisfy invariant 5. `.skillweave/` is tracked here, and 105 files are on the public GitHub mirror as a result.

Invariant 5 cannot simply be applied, because the **test suite** — not the product — reads this repository's own substrate instance as if it were a fixture. Measured by exporting `git archive HEAD` twice, once with and once without `.skillweave/`, and taking the difference against a baseline: **10 tests fail and `tests/test_discovery.py` fails to collect.** Five files carry the whole dependency:

| File | Consumed by | What it actually is |
|---|---|---|
| `.skillweave/phases.yaml` | `test_lifecycle_system.py`, `test_lifecycle_single_source.py` | A generated mirror. `lifecycle.to_yaml()` is the source of truth; the test is named `test_checked_in_yaml_matches_the_generator`. |
| `.skillweave/bundles.yaml` | same | same |
| `.skillweave/config.yaml` | `test_lifecycle_system.py::TestIntegration` | Config the preflight can generate |
| `.skillweave/release/skill-boundaries.yaml` | `test_skill_boundaries.py` | Policy |
| `.skillweave/lib/ideation.py` | `test_discovery.py` (`from ideation import …`) | Project-local library; no `src/skillweave/ideation.py` exists |

None of these is a planning artifact. Disentangling them — generated mirrors and policy into `tests/fixtures/`, `config.yaml` produced by `ensure_folder_structure()` in the test rather than read from disk, `ideation.py` into `src/` or a fixture — is the precondition for adding `.skillweave/` to this repository's `.gitignore`.

`tests/unit/test_substrate_drift.py` is unaffected: it checks only that what is on disk is documented, so an absent substrate leaves it green.

```
Phase 1: Discovery  ──► .skillweave/discovery/, lenses/, prompts/discovery/
      │
Phase 2: Blueprint  ──► .skillweave/prds/, specs/, sequences/, planning/, templates/
      │
Phase 3: Design     ──► .skillweave/design/, lenses/
      │
Phase 4: Build      ──► .skillweave/sequences/, checklists/, tracking-log/
      │
Phase 5: Release    ──► .skillweave/release/, checklists/, archive/, licenses/
      │
Phase 6: Launch     ──► .skillweave/reports/

## 7. Classification by Direction, Durability and Disclosure

Every canonical area additionally carries three axes, each orthogonal to owner, phase and mutability:

- **Direction** — whether the content flows *into* a run (consumed as authored input) or *out of* a run (produced as generated output).
- **Durability** — whether the content is *authored* (written/maintained by humans or shipped as an asset, persistent by intent) or *generated* (machine-produced and recreated/overwritten each cycle).
- **Disclosure** — whether the content is *public* (safe for a public mirror under invariant 5: policy, config, templates, code) or *private* (IP that must stay out of the public mirror: PRDs, discovery findings, plans, handover records).

`pending` means the axis is resolved by an operator decision, not by this document. See section 8.

| Area | Direction | Durability | Disclosure | Reason |
|------|-----------|------------|------------|--------|
| `archive/` | output | generated | private | Historical snapshots of completed runs are machine-written record and project IP. |
| `bundles.yaml` | input | authored | public | Declarative bundle definitions are authored configuration. |
| `checklists/` | pending | pending | pending | See section 8 — authored rubric vs. generated checklist. |
| `cleanup/` | output | generated | private | Inventory and classification outputs are generated per run. |
| `config.yaml` | input | authored | public | Project configuration is authored by the user, not generated. |
| `design/` | output | generated | private | Design tokens and critique reports are produced by the design phase. |
| `discovery/` | output | generated | private | Research findings and council syntheses are generated investigation output. |
| `handover/` | output | generated | private | Session hand-over records are written state between runs. |
| `hooks/` | pending | pending | pending | See section 8 — declarative hook config vs. generated event state. |
| `lenses/` | input | authored | public | Lens specifications are authored policy consumed during planning. |
| `lib/` | input | authored | pending | Helper code is authored; its disclosure hinges on the feature question in section 8. |
| `licenses/` | output | generated | public | Third-party attribution and compliance audits must be disclosed, not hidden. |
| `lifecycle/` | pending | pending | pending | See section 8 — state-machine definition vs. dynamic transition state. |
| `manifesto/` | input | authored | public | Foundational principles are the canonical, shared, non-negotiable vision. |

The two trees implied by Direction:

- **Input tree** (authored, flows in): `bundles.yaml`, `config.yaml`, `lenses/`, `lib/`, `manifesto/`, `phases.yaml`, `prompts/`, `templates/`.
- **Output tree** (generated, flows out): `archive/`, `cleanup/`, `design/`, `discovery/`, `handover/`, `licenses/`, `memory/`, `onboarding-state.yaml`, `planning/`, `prds/`, `reports/`, `rework/`, `sequences/`, `specs/`, `tracking-log/`.
- **Pending** (operator-reserved, see section 8): `checklists/`, `hooks/`, `lifecycle/`, `release/`.

## 8. Pending Operator Decisions

The four areas below each have a reading as *authored policy* and a reading as *generated state*. This document records both readings and the evidence, and deliberately does **not** choose. The operator decides; the implementing/testing lane must not assume one. The same holds for whether `lib/ideation.py` and `lib/assumptions.py` are product features.

### 8.1 `checklists/`
- **Authored-policy reading**: a rubric is a policy — release-readiness and execution checklists encode what must pass before a gate, authored once and re-read each run.
- **Generated-state reading**: `src/skillweave/release/checklist.py` ("Generates markdown checklists from readiness assessment results") and `src/skillweave/execution_checklist.py` (mkdirs and writes `.skillweave/checklists/*`) both *produce* files into this directory each run.
- **Evidence leans**: generated — the two in-tree writers both treat it as output; no in-tree writer reads it as authored input.

### 8.2 `release/`
- **Authored-policy reading**: `skill-boundaries.yaml` (tracked in the fixture) and `readiness-model.yaml` are governed policy; the map's mutability column says "Governed / Policy".
- **Generated-state reading**: `src/skillweave/release/readiness.py` writes `.skillweave/release/security-review.md` (generated review status).
- **Evidence leans**: mixed — the boundaries/model are authored policy, while `security-review.md` is generated; the policy subset dominates by volume but the generated subset is non-zero.

### 8.3 `lifecycle/`
- **Authored-policy reading**: `state-machine.yaml` and `custom-phases.yaml` are authored definitions of the state machine.
- **Generated-state reading**: the map's mutability column says "Engine / State" and "dynamic phase configuration", implying transition state is written during operation.
- **Evidence leans**: inconclusive — no `src/` writer targets `.skillweave/lifecycle/` directly; the nearest generated artefact is `phases.yaml` (a separate area).

### 8.4 `hooks/`
- **Authored-policy reading**: `src/skillweave/studio/hooks/binding/loader.py` reads `.skillweave/hooks/<phase>-<position>.yaml` as declarative hook declarations (authored by the project).
- **Generated-state reading**: `src/skillweave/studio/hooks/discovery/registry.py` writes `.skillweave/hooks/.dismissed.json` (generated dismissal state).
- **Evidence leans**: mixed — declared hooks are authored input, `.dismissed.json` is generated state.

### 8.5 `lib/ideation.py` and `lib/assumptions.py` — product features or project extensions?
- **Product-feature reading**: `tests/test_discovery.py` imports `IdeationSession` and `AssumptionTracker` and exercises them as if they were product surface; if they are features they belong in `src/skillweave/` and in **no** `.skillweave/` asset tier, and would ship (public).
- **Project-extension reading**: nothing under `src/` imports them; the packaged distribution deliberately excludes them (`tests/packaging/test_discovery_installed.py`); the map calls `lib/` "project-specific extensions"; today they exist only under `tests/fixtures/substrate-root/.skillweave/lib/`.
- **Evidence leans**: currently fixture/extension — they ship nowhere and `tests/fixtures/substrate-root/README.md` explicitly flags the "shipped assets" question as open. But the suite's framing and the absence of any `src/` home are exactly why the operator must call it, not the lane.
