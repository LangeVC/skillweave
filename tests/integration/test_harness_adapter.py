"""The generic harness adapter, with the router as decider (SW-158).

Four acceptance criteria, each as a red/green proof:

1. The runner/harness adapter interface is generic and decoupled from
   OpenClaude: ``HarnessAdapter`` is an abstract contract whose own source names
   no concrete harness, and a second plugin with a different identity, a
   different capability set, and a different argv is planned and executed by the
   same generic steps with no core change.
2. SkillWeave passes capability requirements *and* complexity to the router:
   ``AdapterRequest`` carries a ``CapabilityRequirement`` (provider-neutral
   capabilities + the complexity signal) and that exact object reaches
   ``RouterSeam.route`` — proven with a recording seam, not inferred.
3. The router makes the final decision on the model mix and the dispatch
   strategy: swapping only the router changes the decision while the adapter is
   untouched, and the adapter takes the returned ``DispatchStrategy`` verbatim
   (it neither invents nor overrides a model or a strategy).
4. ``OpenClaudeAdapter`` is implemented strictly as a plugin implementing the
   generic interface: it declares its own name/capabilities/argv, is discovered
   through the registry, and refuses by name a decision it cannot honour.

The capability vocabulary is declared on both sides of the one-way
``dispatch -> routing`` dependency; the lockstep assertion here is what keeps
the two copies from drifting. The module also must not pull an optional
subpackage (``runtime``) or ``dispatch`` into the package's eager import
closure, so its imports are scanned rather than assumed.
