"""Core / OSS-profile / Pro-pack boundary contract (SW1312-PRO-BOUNDARY-001).

SkillWeave is four repositories with one owner per concern
(``docs/architecture.md``, "Repository boundary"):

* ``skillweave-sdk``       owns the CONTRACT       (schema bytes + taxonomy value set)
* ``skillweave``           owns the EXECUTION      (runtime, kernel, engine) — this repo
* ``skillweave-profiles``  owns the MEANING        (provider-free profile opinion)
* ``skillweave-packs-pro`` owns COMMERCIAL OPINION (CMS behaviour, provider mappings)

This contract test makes that boundary machine-checkable from inside the Core
repository. It is deliberately hostile to the drift the split exists to remove:
a copied schema authority, a CMS/provider import in Core, a concrete provider
requirement smuggled into a base profile, or a private pack that silently
weakens a Core gate decision must each make this suite red — not be waved
through by a green pipeline (the same "never triggered = unproven" standard an
open/closed gate holds to, see ``tests/unit/conftest.py``).

Every acceptance criterion of SW1312-PRO-BOUNDARY-001 is one test class below.
Sibling repositories are read through ``SKILLWEAVE_SDK_DIR`` /
``SKILLWEAVE_PROFILES_DIR`` / ``SKILLWEAVE_PACKS_PRO_DIR`` (or the sibling
checkout next to this repo) and are fail-closed: if a read-only input that an
assertion depends on cannot be resolved, the assertion names what is missing
rather than silently passing. Assertions about Core itself are self-contained
and run in a bare checkout with no sibling present.
