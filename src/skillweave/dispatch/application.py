"""Operator-dispatch application seam (SW138-DISPATCH-001).

This module is the *single experimental application seam* that consumes the
reviewed dispatch contract (:mod:`skillweave.dispatch.contracts`), the
authoritative profile resolver (:mod:`skillweave.dispatch.profile_resolution`)
and the typed event stream (:mod:`skillweave.dispatch.events`), and drives one
wave of work through the existing routing / fan-out / run / workspace services.

It is deliberately **not** a second subprocess adapter, a second artifact store,
or a second state machine: every concern that already has a home lives there.

* **Process launch** is delegated to
  :func:`skillweave.fanout.dispatch.fan_out_dispatch` (which uses the runtime
  ``runner_adapter``). Nothing here calls ``subprocess.Popen``.
* **Workspace provision/attestation** is delegated to
  :class:`skillweave.workspace.provider.GitWorktreeProvider`. Nothing here
  materialises a worktree itself.
* **Run identity and event emission** use the shared event stream.

The ``execution_model`` enum is enforced *here*, at the live consumer: the legal
values are ``cold``/``warm``/``resume`` and anything else (``hot``) fails before
launch. This is the carry-forward from the contract review.

This seam is **experimental and wave-scoped**: it executes exactly one wave (the
wave the caller names) and makes no claim of stable 1.4 transport compatibility.
