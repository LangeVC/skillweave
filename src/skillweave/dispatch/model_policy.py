"""Provider-neutral model allocation and escalation policy (SW1311-MODEL-001).

This module owns the *policy* that decides which capability tier a task runs
on, and how a lane escalates or blocks when it makes no progress. It is the
single seam under ``dispatch/`` that turns a task's risk profile into a
Flash/Pro allocation, and it is deliberately provider-neutral: it names no
concrete vendor, gateway, router or product model. ``flash`` and ``pro`` are
capability tiers, not product names.

The module is authoritative in eight ways, matching the eight acceptance
criteria:

1. **A product contract declares the model policy.** The
   ``dispatch-sequence.schema.json`` (the shipped contract) carries a
   ``model_policy`` block naming capability/minimum tier, architectural risk,
   cost ceiling and fallback — all without a vendor/gateway prefix.

2. **Requested, gateway-resolved and answering model are three separate
   facts.** :class:`ModelAttribution` keeps them apart; an unknown attribution
   is reported as unknown, never synthesised.

3. **Namespace/prefix is adapter/profile data.** This module reads a prefix as
   opaque data and never interprets or strips it; translation belongs to the
   owning adapter boundary exactly once.

4. **Allocation is risk-shaped, not size-shaped.** :func:`allocate` weighs
   discovery vs action, task type, recall/precision, blast radius,
   reversibility, state/concurrency, migration, security, integration,
   ambiguity, error profile and coverage. File count alone never decides.

5. **Flash is allowed only for bounded, low-risk work.** Bounded low-risk/bug
   discovery may run on Flash. Architecture, high-blast, migration, security,
   causal and ambiguous rework, and critical review require Pro unless an
   explicit, reasoned override is recorded.

6. **Escalation is bounded.** After two non-progress or accepted review-fail
   cycles a Flash allocation escalates to Pro if the cost ceiling permits,
   otherwise it blocks explicitly. There is never an infinite loop.

7. **Technical failures are not review failures.** Provider unavailability,
   rate limits, launch failures and attribution failures are technical; they
   consume no correction round and never become ``REVIEW_FAIL``.

8. **Tokens/latency/cost are receipt-bound.** :class:`ModelReceipt` records
   them only when measured, otherwise as unavailable with a reason; transfer
   observations cannot mutate policy.
