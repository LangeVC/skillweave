"""Provider-neutral harness adapter contract and strict-controller binding (SW1311-HARNESS-001).

This module owns two things and nothing else:

1. **The adapter capability profile** as declarable data. A profile declares which
   of the eight dispatch capabilities an adapter supports (native tool launch,
   external child process, in-place execution, stdin transport, status, cancel,
   state namespace, and installed-skill digests), which authority a role holds,
   how it may delegate, and its four independently evidenced run-statuses
   (documented, installed, dispatch-proven, production) as separate facts.

   The module is deliberately provider-neutral: it contains **no literal harness
   name and no branch on any concrete adapter**. A concrete harness name belongs
   in the adapter's own data file key, which this module reads as opaque data.
   Adding a harness edits data; it never adds a branch here.

2. **The experimental strict-controller binding.** Strict mode refuses a dispatch
   unless the validated sequence, the resolved profile, the exact task brief and
   the installed skill digests are all bound. A missing, stale, or mismatched
   skill/capability digest fails closed *before* worker launch and names the
   mismatched asset. A harness-native delegation or direct-shell bypass is
   recorded and fails closed when strict mode requires SkillWeave dispatch.

   Strict mode is experimental and fail-closed: nothing is defaulted into a
   binding, and a refusal always names the asset that failed, never a bare NO.
