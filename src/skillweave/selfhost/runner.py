"""Self-hosting runner: two Ops lanes, two reviews, one dependent lane.

``SW-SELFHOST-001``. The fixture describes a small SkillWeave sequence; the
runner executes it with **no manual worktree or session control**. Every part of
the control plane is a real object that the runner wires together:

* **Worktrees** — ``GitWorktreeProvider.acquire`` materialises an exclusive
  worktree/branch from the full base SHA (``SW-WORKSPACE-001``).
* **Root cursor** — ``Coordinator`` is the sole root-DAG writer; the runner
  commits each lane under the coordinator role and nothing else mutates it
  (``SW-COORD-001``).
* **Reviews** — ``ReviewGate`` releases a review child-run only after the pinned
  remote SHA matches the fetched SHA and the reviewer is read-only
  (``SW-REVIEW-001``).
* **Execution** — the two Ops lanes fan out as real overlapping subprocesses
  through the canonical seam (``SW-FANOUT-001`` / ``SW-RUN-SVC-001``), each with
  its own child run; the dependent lane runs only after the two Ops lanes have
  committed.

The runner returns a :class:`SelfHostResult` carrying the measured overlap, the
committed cursor, and the released reviews — all reproducible, none fabricated,
and none using the quarantined simulator.
