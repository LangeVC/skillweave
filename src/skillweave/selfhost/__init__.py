"""Internal self-hosting entry (SW-SELFHOST-001).

SkillWeave drives its own small Ops/Review sequence with no manual worktree or
session control. ``SelfHostRunner`` is that entry: it takes a declarative
``SelfHostFixture`` (two Ops lanes, two reviews, one dependent lane) and runs it
through the canonical path — real subprocesses via the fan-out/run-service seam,
coordinator-governed root cursor, and pinned-SHA-gated reviews — producing
nothing a human had to hand-wire.

The runner performs *no* manual worktree/session control: worktrees come from
``workspace.GitWorktreeProvider``, the root cursor from ``coordinator.Coordinator``,
reviews from ``review.ReviewGate``, and the actual execution from the real
subprocess seam. The fixture is data; the runner wires it.
