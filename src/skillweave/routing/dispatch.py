"""Tool-agnostic dispatch: launch a role's tool and bind the result as evidence.

``profile.py`` declares what a role's tool is — its name, launch command, and
arguments (:class:`~skillweave.routing.profile.ToolSpec`). This module is the
seam that *uses* that declaration: it hands the work to the launched process,
collects what came back, and binds it to the run as evidence, never as free
text. A role that carries no tool runs in place and is recorded as having done
so; a launch that never starts is a named failure carrying the command that
failed — never a run without a result.

The adapter is tool-agnostic by construction. It receives the tool name, the
launch command, the arguments, and the work, and it does not branch on any of
them: the tool name is recorded on the result, never inspected. The first
consumer of the seam is a caller, not the shape of the interface — no concrete
tool name appears anywhere in this module.

Four criteria are discharged here:

1. A role carrying a ``ToolSpec`` is launched from its ``launch_command`` and
   ``args``; the work is handed over to that process and the result is
   collected and bound to the run as evidence — an ``ArtifactReceipt`` carrying
   the collected output, typed ``artifact`` and addressed by digest, not free
   text.

2. The adapter branches on none of its inputs. The tool name, launch command,
   arguments, and work are all passed through: none is inspected to choose a
   path. A test asserts that no concrete tool name appears in this module.

3. A role WITHOUT a ``ToolSpec`` runs in place and is recorded as having done
   so — an explicit ``InPlaceRecord``, not an absent one. Running in the current
   harness is a declared configuration and must be distinguishable afterwards
   from a dispatch that silently did not happen.

4. A failing launch is a ``DispatchFailure`` carrying the command that failed.
   A tool that never starts is never recorded as a run without a result: the
   never-started case returns a typed failure naming the command, never a
   silent empty success.

5. ``dispatch`` and ``launch_from_role`` take a ``timeout`` and pass it to the
   runtime, which already accepts one. A caller that sets none gets a
   *documented* default (:data:`DEFAULT_DISPATCH_TIMEOUT`), never an unbounded
   wait and never a number invented by whoever wrote the proof. A timeout is
   reported as a timeout (``result.termination == "timed_out"``), never as a
   failure of the tool.

6. The record distinguishes DECLARED from TERMINATED. DECLARED is the timeout
   cap the caller set (or the documented default) — carried as ``timeout`` on
   the :class:`DispatchResult` and in the artifact metadata. TERMINATED is how
   the process actually ended — ``result.termination`` ("exited", "signaled",
   "cancelled", "timed_out"). A dispatch that launched correctly and was cut
   short has ``termination == "timed_out"`` while ``succeeded`` is False; a
   later reader needs both facts, so both are recorded separately.

The launch itself is delegated to ``runtime.runner_adapter``, which owns the
process concerns (real subprocess, capture, timeout, cancel, exit/signal split).
This module contributes only what routing adds on top: reading the launch
command from the spec, tokenising it, appending the spec's arguments, handing
the work over as input, promoting the collected output into bound evidence, and
turning the three role outcomes (launched, in-place, never-started) into typed
records — and, since SW-RT-008, passing the caller's timeout through and keeping
the declared cap apart from the terminating state.
