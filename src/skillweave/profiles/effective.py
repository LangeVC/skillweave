"""Immutable effective-profile snapshot (SW1312-PROFILE-RESOLVE-001).

This module owns the *resolution* of explicit profile sources into one
content-addressed, fully explained, immutable snapshot that a run may pin.
It is the single consumer-side seam between the SDK profile contract and the
promptchain/dispatch consumers (SW1312-CHAIN-001); nothing else under
``skillweave/`` may re-resolve a profile.

The canonical precedence chain, exactly as the PRD orders it::

    run override > project profile > organization profile
        > domain pack > category pack > core defaults

A source is any *typed preview artifact* (a WorkProfile, LifecycleProfile,
deliverable/evidence contract, or a pack) together with its provenance: a
source id, a source version, and the SDK schema version/digest it was authored
against. The resolver walks the chain from the strongest source (run override)
down to the weakest (core defaults), merging overlay key-by-key. Nothing is
silently dropped: every key that a source declares is either (a) carried into
the snapshot at its winning precedence, (b) merged merge-by-merge, or (c)
refused as a *non-mergeable conflict* naming the exact source paths.

The result is a :class:`EffectiveProfileSnapshot`:

* ``resolved`` — the merged effective content, with no hidden default: every
  field in the effective output is attributable to exactly one winning source.
* ``provenance`` — per-key source id / source version for every inherited
  value, so "why is this value here" is answerable without re-reading a file.
* ``sources`` — the ordered, complete list of every source that contributed,
  each with its id, version, schema version and schema digest, making the
  input set itself part of the snapshot.
* ``sdk`` — the pinned SDK schema version and digest under which the snapshot
  is bound.
* ``preview_dimensions`` — every preview-only runtime dimension carried as a
  *declaration* (ordered phases, K0-K6 mappings, topology, control, human
  coupling, change surfaces, autonomy bounds, provider capability names).
  These are preserved verbatim and reported; they are **not** executed.
  Requesting execution of an unsupported dimension fails explicitly.

The snapshot digest is content-addressed over canonical bytes of the resolved
content in source order, so identical ordered inputs produce byte-identical
snapshots and the same digest — and a source changed *after* the snapshot is
built cannot alter it, because the resolver copies data in, it never holds a
live reference.

# The SDK (skillweave-sdk) is contract authority. It owns the preview schema

# ``skillweave_sdk.validator`` ``PREVIEW_SCHEMA_VERSION`` / ``EXPECTED_SCHEMA_DIGEST``
# and are checked against an injected schema-set digest at resolution time, so
# the core can bind the SDK without importing it (the SDK must stay importable
# with no runtime present). A divergence from the canonical SDK is an error,
# never a silent drift.
