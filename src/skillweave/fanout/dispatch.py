"""Dependency-ready fan-out (SW-FANOUT-001).

Replaces the sequential batch loop with a genuine fan-out: independent workers
are started as real processes at the same time, overlap in time, and each keeps
its own child run and its own raw artifact. The sequential ``dispatch_batch``
waited for each worker before starting the next; this module starts them all,
then waits for all, so overlap is a measured fact, not a claim.

The primitive is ``skillweave.runtime.runner_adapter.start_process``: it returns
a live handle for a process started in its own session, so a caller can start
N workers and then reap them. This module owns the fan-out *wiring* only — the
actual process concerns (spawn, capture, cancel, timeout) stay in
``runner_adapter``. Each child runs under a distinct ``child_run_id`` derived
from the parent, and each produces its own ``ArtifactReceipt`` (raw artifact,
content-addressed), so two children never share one run or one artifact.

    All workers are started before any is reaped, so they overlap in time.
    Each worker runs under ``<run_id>-<index>`` (a distinct child run identity)
    and produces its own raw artifact; nothing is shared between children.

    Each child resolves its own model:

    * ``models`` (optional) is a list of ``ModelSpec`` aligned to ``commands`` —
      one concrete id or delegated router+scenario per child. Each child's spec
      is resolved to a concrete model string and threaded into that child's own
      ``start_process`` call, so two children may answer from different models.
    * ``model`` (optional) is the backward-compatible single model: it is lifted
      to ``concrete(model)`` for *every* child, preserving the prior contract
      that a single ``model`` applies to all. It is ignored when ``models`` is
      given.

    ``launch_contexts`` (optional) is a per-child launch identity, length-aligned
    to ``commands``: one ``FanOutLaunchContext`` per child carrying that child's
    own ``subject_repo``/``subject_commit``/``tool``/``cwd``. When supplied, each
    child's identity comes from its own context, never from the group's scalar
    values — a heterogeneous parallel group (mixed repos, roles, tools, or
    attested worktrees) is represented faithfully. Alignment is fail-closed,
    like the per-child ``models`` list: a length mismatch raises before any
    process starts. When omitted, the scalar ``subject_repo``/``subject_commit``/
    ``tool``/``cwd`` apply to every child, preserving the prior contract.

    At least one of ``model`` / ``models`` must be supplied. A worker that dies
    without a result is a failure with a message, never a silent success — the
    child's ``ProcessResult.succeeded`` carries that fact.

    ``timeout`` (optional) forwards to each child's ``wait``: a child exceeding
    it ends in the defined ``timed_out`` outcome (distinct from an exit, signal,
    or launch failure) rather than hanging the whole fan-out.

    ``artifact_store`` (optional) is the shared ``RawArtifactStore`` (the run /
    application-owned content-addressed store). When supplied, every child's
    captured stdout and stderr bytes are put into it *before* the child's
    receipt references are returned, and each reference is re-verified against
    the store (digest, byte length, declared encoding). A returned reference is
    therefore immediately resolvable from the store by a caller that received
    no bytes out-of-band.
