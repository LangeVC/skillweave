## Ralph Loop Adaptations

### Binary Criteria Design
Every acceptance criterion must be:
1. **Testable**: Can be verified with automated tests
2. **Binary**: Clear pass/fail condition
3. **Measurable**: Quantitative where possible
4. **Independent**: Doesn't depend on subjective judgment

**Bad Examples:**
- "The UI should look good" (subjective)
- "Users should find it intuitive" (vague)

**Good Examples:**
- "All buttons have hover states (CSS :hover)"
- "Form validation shows errors within 500ms of submission"
- "API returns 200 status code for valid requests"

### Task Decomposition Principles
1. **Atomic**: Each task completes in one AI iteration
2. **Context-Fitting**: Task fits within LLM context window
3. **Verifiable**: Clear completion criteria
4. **Independent**: Minimal dependencies on other tasks
5. **Committable**: Results in a working, committable change

### Memory System Integration
**Short-term (progress.txt):**
- Iteration-by-iteration tracking
- What worked/what didn't
- Technical decisions and rationale

**Long-term (agents.md):**
- Project-specific patterns
- Code standards and conventions
- Integration knowledge
- Bug patterns and solutions

## Usage Notes for AI Execution

1. **Start with Discovery**: Use interview questions to fill template
2. **Validate Assumptions**: Challenge each assumption
3. **Prioritize Ruthlessly**: Use MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won't)
4. **Define "Done"**: Clear completion criteria for each phase
5. **Plan for Iteration**: Assume requirements will evolve

## Integration with SkillWeave

This PRD template is designed for:
1. **Blueprint Skill**: Creates structured PRD from interview
2. **PromptChain Skill**: Generates execution sequences from PRD
3. **ReleaseChain Skill**: Executes tasks with Ralph Loop principles
